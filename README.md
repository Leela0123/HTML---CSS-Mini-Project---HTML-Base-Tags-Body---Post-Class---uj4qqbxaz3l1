# **Parallax Website**

## ****The parallax effect has been around for years in classic video games, but it became a trend in the web design world. This cool effect is now commonly seen as part of the scrolling feature of a web page. It uses multiple backgrounds which seem to move at different speeds to create a sensation of depth (creating a faux-3D effect) and an interesting browsing experience.****



The whole project  consists of two parts:


1.HTML PART 
this part gives basic layout to the website by adding diferent html tags 

2.CSS PART
The funtionality to this website is added by css coding to make it more presentable
Media query is used to give  paralax effect in the website
